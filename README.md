# Optic - Map Mission Management system

# Backend using NodeJS
# Frontend using ReactJS


Optic is a full stack web application that combines my skills in React, MapBox, and MongoDB with my knowledge of NLP and ML. The project was inspired by Palantir Gaia and combines the power of the MERN stack with advanced mapping and communication features.

One of the key features of Optic is the use of pins to denote specific missions on the map region. These pins, or markers, allow users to easily identify and prioritize key areas on the map. Users can view and add pins to the map, and the pins are color-coded based on the user's login status. Optic also includes a login and authentication system to ensure that only authorized users have access to the pin management features.

In addition to the mission management and communication features, Optic is also integrated with Nests, which are synchronised communication rooms powered by sockets. This integration is not inspired by my SyncNest project, but rather is an actual integration with SyncNest, my code collaboration tool built with Express and Socket.io. This integration allows for real-time collaboration and communication among team members.

Optic also includes a threat detection model to analyse threats in texts using sentiment analysis powered by Keras. This model allows users to identify and prioritize potential threats in real-time, making the project suitable for a wide range of mission-critical scenarios.
