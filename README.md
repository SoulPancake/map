Optic is a full stack web application that combines my skills in React, MapBox, and MongoDB with my knowledge of NLP and ML. The project was inspired by Palantir Gotham's Gaia, Cosmos and combines the power of the MERN stack with advanced mapping and communication features.

One of the key features of Optic is the use of pins to denote specific missions on the map region. These pins, or markers, allow users to easily identify and prioritize key areas on the map, and are inspired by the strategic cross-combatant command collaboration tool, Cosmos. Users can view and add pins to the map, and the pins are color-coded based on the user's login status and pin ownership. Optic also includes a login and authentication system to ensure that only authorized users have access to the pin management features.

Marking critical regions in the map using polygon overlays:

In addition to the mission management and communication features, Optic is also integrated with Nests, which are synchronised communication rooms powered by sockets. This is an actual integration with SyncNest, which is other my code collaboration project tool built with Express and Socket.io. This integration allows for real-time collaboration and communication among team members, and is inspired by the operational level global all-domain awareness tool, Gaia.

Optic also includes a threat analysis model that is inspired by Palantir Dossier. This model is trained on the Comment Toxicity dataset and runs on a Flask server built on top of a Keras model. It allows users to identify and prioritize potential threats in real-time, making the project suitable for a wide range of mission-critical scenarios. This integration showcases my experience in the domain of NLP and in the vicinity of machine learning tools and technologies, inspired by the threat analysis capabilities provided by Gaia and Cosmos.
